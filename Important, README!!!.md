Hi, I'm Wanpet, the truth is I'm from Mexico and I'm Bilingual (that is, I speak Spanish and English) I'm a child (for obvious reasons I'm not going to say my age), well, I have experience with Malware, I'm just creating malware I really did the others with a notepad, the following malware is called XVertexX, it's destructive and I'm doing it with Visual Studio 2019, I'm Wanpet (I already said it like 1000 times XD) and take care, ah, and I recommend you install viruses in virtual machine :).
